When upgrading from a Longhorn version >= 1.2.0 and <= v1.2.3 to varchives, if your cluster has many backups, you may expect to have a long upgrade time (with 22000 backups, it could take a few hours). Helm upgrade may timeout and you may need to re-run the upgrade command or set a longer timeout. This is [a known issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3890)
